## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project
and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, discriminatory language, or unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information without consent

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at: cashlycash.g@gmail.com.
All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project
maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public when
an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Attribution
